# Facebook-Ai-Comments-Replier
I built an AI Social Media Coordinator for a Facebook Page that automatically replies to new comments. It uses the Facebook Graph API to poll recent Page posts and read comments, then generates short on-brand replies using a local Ollama Llama 3.1 model, and posts the replies back to Facebook. To prevent spam/duplicates it stores handled comment IDs in a local SQLite database, supports a safe DRY_RUN mode, and includes post-processing to clean the model output plus checks for comment visibility (hidden/private) after posting.
